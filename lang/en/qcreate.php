<h1>Ratio of Automatic / Manual Grading</h1>

<p>Here you specify how the total Grade will be divided: the percentage for the Automatic grade is on the left, and the Manual grade is on the right.</p>

<p>The automatic grade is the grade 'given' by the system for simply making a question. So, for example if you require students to make 10 questions, and you assign 100% for Automatic grading, a student that makes 7 questions will get 70% for the activity. On the other hand, if you asign 50% for Automatic grading, a student that creates 7 questions will get 35% for the activity (7/10 x 50% = 35%).</p>

<p>Note that the automatic grade is no guarantee of quality. The Automatic grade is best used in the following situations:</p>

<p>1) ...when you want to reward students for simply making the correct number of corrections. In  this case, it is probably best to keep the weight for the automatic grade low.</p>

<p>2) ...when you are confident that the quality of the questioins your students produce is not in doubt. For example, your students if your students are both experienced at creating questions with Moodle, and experienced at writing questions in general then a high weight or even 100% for the autimatic grade may be appropriate.</p>


<p>The Manual grade is the grade that you give for each question. So, if you asign 50% for Automatic grading, the other half of the grade will be your manually assigned grade. So, if a student creates 7 questions, they will get 35% Automatic grade, and if you grade each question as perfect they will get a total of 70% (35% automatic + 35% manual). On the other hand, if the questions have problems and you only give 60% for each question of the 7 questions, the student's total grade will be 56%. Note, it is possible to give different grades to each question. The calculation is as follows:</p>

<p>Automatic grade = 7/10 x 50% = 35%</p>

<p>Manual grade = (60% + 60% +60% + 60% + 60% + 60% + 60%)/7 x 35% = 21%</p>

<p>Total = 35% + 21% = 56%</p>

<p>
Another example:<br />
Here, students are required to make 5 questions. The Ratio of Automatic
/ Manual Grading is 20%/80%.<br />
A student creates all 5 questions, so gets the full 20% for the automatic grade, but the quality of each question is not perfect. As a result the student's grades could look somehting like this:<br />
<table style="text-align: left;" border="1"

    <tr>
      <td><br />

<h1>Graded Question Types</h1>

<p>Here you specify the type of questions that need to be made. If you select "Allow all question types", then students can make any type of question up to the total specified in "Total Questions Graded".</p>

<p>If your students already know how to make questions, and they know the differences between the question types, it is safe to select "Allow all question types". However, if they are new to question creation, it is probably best to specify here the type of questions you want students to create.</p>

<h2>Example 1:</h2>
<p>If you select '4' in "Total Questions Graded", and check "Allow all question types" in "Graded Question Types", students will be able to create any type of questions; they could be 4 of the same type or a combination of question types. Note, the "Will Grade Minimum Number of Questions of Type" menus do not need to be set at all.</p>

<h2>Example 2:</h2>
<p>If you select '4' in "Total Questions Graded", and in "Graded Question Types" you check "Multiple Choice", students will have to create 4 Multiple choice questions. Again, the "Will Grade Minimum Number of Questions of Type" menus do not need to be set at all.</p>

<h2>Example 3:</h2>
<p>If you select '4' in "Total Questions Graded", and check "Matching" and "Multiple Choice" in "Graded Question Types", students will have to make a total of 4 questions; they could be all Matching, all Multiple Choice, or a combination of the two.</p>

<p><em>Note, if you want to to specify exactly what type of questions and how many of each type students should create, you need to indicate these parameters in the "Will Grade Minimum Number of Questions of Type" menus.
</em></p>

If you select a number higher than 4, then students will be able to create other questions in excess of the two Matching and two Multiple Choice types.

<p>4) preview, view / save as new and edit / delete: this is the higest level access that students can have. For an activity in which you want students to go through an ioterative process of question creation, evaluation, and improvemnt,  this is proabably the best setting.</p>';
